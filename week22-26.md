<p>this week we learned about arrays and objects. We learned how to put our objects and their parmeters on the website page instead of just console.loging them. We did this by using query.selector. We also learned what an array is and how to add them or put them in the console. Overall, this week was all about javascript. I learned that in an array it starts with 0 and not 1. I want to learn how to make my website more interactive. However, I still don't understand why we have to use query.selector when we can just use the p tag? </p>.
